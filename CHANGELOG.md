    - Addresses 
    - Disks
    - Projects
    - Routes
    - Operations
    - Networks
    - Subnetworks
  - Fix compute tests Rake task.
  - Remove old tests and helpers for Disk, Addresses and Networks.
- \#394 Improve `Server` model test coverage + miscellaneous improvements. [temikus]
  - Add source_image parameter to `DiskFactory` so the Servers factory creates
    properly running instances.

## 1.0.1

\#290 - Fixes paperclip integration
\#288 - Fixes typo in server network code

## 1.0.0

1.0.0!!!!!!!!!!!!

This rewrites everything except for the legacy storage backend!

Shoutout to @emilymye, @Temikus, @DawidJanczak, @Everlag and everyone who has been asking for this for ~forever.

We did this major refactor because as of version 0.9, google-api-client rewrote their entire api, thus limiting our ability to integrate with google APIs, and also running into a bunch of deprecated gem collisions.

You no longer need to require google-api-client, we are now doing that for you.

HELP: We need help testing. Please report bugs! As this is a complete rewrite of the request layer, there are undoubetedly bugs. We had to throw away most of our tests, and due to the time this has taken us, we chose to ship, instead of writing tests for everything all over again. If you would like to write tests, we would love your PRs, as well as any ideas you have about how we can test this code better.

Thanks!
