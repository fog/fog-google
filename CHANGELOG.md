### User-facing

fog-core v2.2 and up now requires `Fog::Google:<service>` instead of `Fog::<service>::Google`.
There are shims in place that will provide backwards compatibility for the latter with
a deprecation warning, but you should update your code accordingly. The next major release
will drop support of the old format.

## 1.0.1

\#290 - Fixes paperclip integration
\#288 - Fixes typo in server network code

## 1.0.0

1.0.0!!!!!!!!!!!!

This rewrites everything except for the legacy storage backend!

Shoutout to @emilymye, @Temikus, @DawidJanczak, @Everlag and everyone who has been asking for this for ~forever.

We did this major refactor because as of version 0.9, google-api-client rewrote their entire api, thus limiting our ability to integrate with google APIs, and also running into a bunch of deprecated gem collisions.

You no longer need to require google-api-client, we are now doing that for you.

HELP: We need help testing. Please report bugs! As this is a complete rewrite of the request layer, there are undoubetedly bugs. We had to throw away most of our tests, and due to the time this has taken us, we chose to ship, instead of writing tests for everything all over again. If you would like to write tests, we would love your PRs, as well as any ideas you have about how we can test this code better.

Thanks!

## 0.6.0

NOTE: New Monitoring models are not compatible in any way to old ones because of significant rewrite to monitoring api since v2beta2.

## 0.5.5

Adds support for SSL certificates, https proxies and global IP addresses: #244

## 0.5.4

Fixes a storage bug #224 and fixes an issue with compute snapshots #240

## 0.5.3

Fixes a bunch of bugs and adds subnetworks support.

PRs that change functionality: #212, #215, #203, #198, #201, #221, #222, #216

## 0.5.2

Rapid-releasing 0.5.2 due to regression fixed by #190 still present in v0.5.1
We encourage people using 0.5.1 to upgrade.
